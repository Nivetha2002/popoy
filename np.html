      <p><em class="txtrr">Every little kid has heroes.<br>
        Most kids in my generation followed the ninja turtles, wrestlers...,<br>
        Not that I didnâ€™t like them, but my hero was quite different from all the usual heroes.<br>
        My biggest hero was Popeye, the Sailor Man.<br>
        To me, Popeye was the ultimate. He always did the right thing no matter what.<br>
        Popeye had a girlfriend, and he got to wear a really cool sailor suit.<br>
        And with a can of spinach, he could take anyone on, and come out victorious.<br>
        Anyway, I was pretty well obsessed with Popeye.</em></p>
